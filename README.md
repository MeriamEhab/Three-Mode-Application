# Three-Mode-Application
This README provides an overview of the project and its objectives. It describes the features and modes of the project, along with the required hardware components and the skills you will gain by completing the project.
# Project Introduction:
This project focuses on microcontroller architecture and embedded C programming. It serves as an assessment of your engineering design skills and knowledge acquired during the course. The project involves building a simple calculator with additional features of a timer and a stopwatch using the Arm Cortex M4 TivaC microcontroller.
# Three main modes
1.Calculator 
2.Timer 
3.Stopwatch
# Calculator Mode:
User inputs two numbers (each more than 1 digit) and a mathematical operator using the keypad. The numbers and the operator are displayed on the LCD. The calculator performs the operation and prints the result on the LCD.
# Timer Mode:
The user sets a specific time using the keypad. The timer starts counting down and triggers a buzzer when it reaches zero. The remaining time is displayed on the LCD.
# Stopwatch Mode:
The user controls the stopwatch using three buttons: start, pause, and reset. The stopwatch increments and displays the elapsed time on the LCD. The user can pause and reset the stopwatch as needed.
# Hardware Requirements:
Arm Cortex M4 TivaC microcontroller LCD display Keypad for number inputs Push buttons for mode switching and stopwatch control Buzzer for the timer mode.
# Drivers:
1.Timer
2.GPIO
3.LCD
4.KEYPAD
